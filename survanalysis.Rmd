## **8. Cox Proportional Hazards Model for Risk Factors**
The Cox model estimates the effect of multiple covariates on survival time.

```{r}
# Fit the Cox Proportional Hazards Model
cox_model <- coxph(surv_obj ~ age + treatment + clinical_stage, data = cancer_df)

# Summary of the model
summary(cox_model)

## **9. Plot Hazard Ratios**
```{r}
ggforest(cox_model, data = cancer_df)
